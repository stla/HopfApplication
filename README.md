# HopfApplication

Any spherical curve corresponds to a Hopf torus. The Hopf torus lives in the four-dimensional space but it becomes a beautiful 3D object after stereographic projection. This application made with **three.js** allows to change the parameters of a spherical curve and plots the stereographic projection of the corresponding Hopf torus. The JavaScript code for the parameterized spherical curve is a translation of some Python code that can be found in the **splines** library.
